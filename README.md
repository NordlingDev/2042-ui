## I changed the original on/off switches to be more accessible

I spent my evening programming this simple interactive UI that focuses on the switch component. Feel free to give critics and tips on how to improve them even more.

The first one replicates the original design while the custom ones are there as alternatives with the goal to be more accessible and visually pleasing. I'm open to change them or add more examples if given. Hopefully this can give DICE some further insights.
